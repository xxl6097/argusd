## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-10

User request: dashboard should show device vendor and let me set a
static IP from the UI. The first is a column addition; the second is
a new mutating API that touches the router's `/etc/config/dhcp` and
reloads dnsmasq, gated behind the same auth predicate as the alias
write API.

Library API and semantics unchanged. All new code lives in
`argusweb`; the static-IP feature auto-disables when not running on
OpenWrt (no `uci` in `$PATH` or `/etc/config/dhcp` unreadable).

### Added · 新增

- **Vendor column** in the Known Devices list. Desktop table gains
  a "厂商 · Vendor" column populated from `Device.Vendor` (already
  in the library/JSON since v0.6.0). Mobile cards add a third row
  showing "厂商 <vendor>". Wired devices and rows without vendor
  data show "—".

- **`DHCPManager` interface** for static DHCP reservations:
  ```go
  type DHCPManager interface {
      List(ctx) (map[string]StaticLease, error)
      Set(ctx, StaticLease) error
      Delete(ctx, mac string) error
  }
  ```
  Plus `StaticLease{MAC, IP, Name}` struct, `WithDHCPManager(m)`
  Option, and `ErrDHCPManagerUnavailable` sentinel for graceful
  fallback on non-OpenWrt hosts.

- **`UCIDHCPManager`** — OpenWrt implementation:
  - Constructor `NewUCIDHCPManager()` probes `uci show dhcp` and
    returns `ErrDHCPManagerUnavailable` when not on an OpenWrt box
  - Set/Delete are serialized (single internal mutex), apply on
    `/etc/config/dhcp` via uci, then reload dnsmasq
  - New entries created as named sections (`dhcp.argus_<mac-suffix>`)
    so writes are idempotent and don't shift indices when other
    entries are added/removed by LuCI or the user
  - Updates of existing anonymous `dhcp.@host[N]` entries (typically
    created by LuCI before argusd was installed) update in place
    without renaming
  - Defense-in-depth: every mutation is preceded by `uci revert dhcp`
    and reverted on error, so failed POSTs leave no pending state
  - Strict input validation against shell/uci injection: MAC matches
    `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`, IP via `net.ParseIP` + IPv4 check, name
    `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. Names with spaces or shell metachars are
    rejected with 400.

- **`/api/dhcp` HTTP routes**:
  - `GET /api/dhcp` — list current reservations as
    `{"leases": {MAC(upper): {mac, ip, name}, ...}}`
  - `POST /api/dhcp` `{"mac": "...", "ip": "...", "name": "..."}`
    — create/update a reservation. Empty name auto-generates
    `argus-<mac-suffix>`. Gated by write-auth.
  - `DELETE /api/dhcp?mac=...` — remove a reservation. Gated.
  - `503` when the server was built without `WithDHCPManager`.

- **`/api/devices` capabilities block** — top-level body now
  includes `"capabilities": {"aliases": bool, "dhcp": bool}` so the
  dashboard knows which features to surface (e.g. hide the static-IP
  button on hosts without a DHCP manager).

- **Dashboard static-IP UI**:
  - A 📌 button next to each device's IP opens a modal:
    "静态 IP · Static IP" prefilled with current IP and existing
    reservation name (if any). Save / Remove (when a reservation
    exists) / Cancel buttons. Enter saves; Esc cancels.
  - When a device has a static reservation, its IP cell shows
    🔒 prefix in accent color so you can tell at a glance which
    devices are pinned.
  - The pencil ✎ rename button (v0.14.0) is unaffected — both
    affordances coexist.

- **`argusd` auto-detect** — `argusd -listen=...` now probes for
  `uci` at startup and silently wires `UCIDHCPManager` when
  available; logs `DHCP 静态租约管理已启用 (uci)` on success or
  the detection failure on stderr. Dev laptops see the latter and
  the dashboard hides the 📌 button.

### Tests

- 14 new test cases in `argusweb/dhcp_test.go`:
  - Parser: 4 cases covering multi-host output, incomplete entries,
    unrelated sections, and named sections
  - Validators: MAC / IPv4 / name with explicit bad inputs (shell
    injection, oversized names) — confirms refusal
  - HTTP routes: GET returns leases, POST writes, POST rejects bad
    IP, DELETE removes, 503 without manager, 403 with denying auth
  - `NewUCIDHCPManager` returns wrapped `ErrDHCPManagerUnavailable`
    when `uci` is missing from PATH
  - Capabilities block correctly advertises feature availability

### End-to-end UAT (MT7981 router)

Verified:
- `argusd` auto-enables DHCP management at startup ✅
- POST creates `dhcp.argus_<suffix>=host` entry, commits, reloads
  dnsmasq ✅
- POST same MAC with new name updates in place (no duplicate
  section) ✅
- DELETE removes the section cleanly ✅
- Final `uci show dhcp` matches pre-test state — no leftovers ✅
- `/api/devices` carries `capabilities.dhcp=true` and `vendor`
  column data ✅

### Caveats

- **OpenWrt-specific.** The dashboard's 📌 button is hidden and
  `/api/dhcp` returns 503 on hosts without `uci` (Debian routers,
  pfSense, dev laptops). A user implementing `DHCPManager` against
  another platform's CLI/socket can wire it via `WithDHCPManager`.
- **dnsmasq reload is non-instantaneous.** A new reservation takes
  effect on the device's next DHCP renewal (typically ≤ leasetime
  seconds after the device next requests its lease). Existing
  leases remain bound to the previously-allocated IP until they
  renew.
- **Subnet validation is not performed.** The implementation only
  validates IPv4 syntax, not membership in the LAN subnet. An IP
  outside the configured DHCP pool will be persisted but ignored
  by dnsmasq. Future versions may add subnet checks.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-10

User request: devices using iOS 15+/Android 10+ "private WiFi
address" show up with their random MAC as both MAC *and* hostname —
you should be able to give them a friendly name in the dashboard and
have it stick.

Purely additive; library API and semantics unchanged.

### Added · 新增

- **Persistent alias store** — `argusweb.NewAliasStore(path string) *AliasStore`
  maintains a MAC → friendly-name map, backed by a JSON file
  (atomic write-tmp + rename). Corrupt files are treated as empty
  and repaired on the next successful write. Methods:
  `Lookup(mac) string`, `Set(mac, name) error` (empty name deletes),
  `All() map[string]string`. Empty-path constructor produces an
  in-memory store (handy for tests).

- **Server options** (all on `argusweb.Server`):
  - `WithAliases(*AliasStore)` — attach a store; `/api/devices` rows
    gain an optional `alias` field, dashboard prefers the alias for
    display
  - `WithWriteAuth(func(*http.Request) bool)` — gate mutating APIs;
    default policy allows loopback and RFC1918 private networks,
    which covers the common `-listen=0.0.0.0:9099` home-LAN case

- **REST endpoints for aliases** — `GET|POST|DELETE /api/aliases`:
  - `GET /api/aliases` → `{"aliases": {MAC(upper): name, ...}}`
  - `POST /api/aliases` `{"mac": "...", "name": "..."}` sets or
    clears (empty name deletes). Gated by write-auth.
  - `DELETE /api/aliases?mac=...` deletes. Gated by write-auth.
  - Without `WithAliases`, all three return `503`.

- **Inline rename in the dashboard** — each row's hostname cell
  shows a ✎ pencil button. Click → inline input → Enter to save
  / Esc to cancel / "清除" clears the alias. The alias is shown in
  accent color, with the original hostname kept as a grey hint in
  parentheses. Works on mobile (card layout) too.

- **`argusd -aliases=<path>`** CLI flag (default
  `/etc/argusd/aliases.json`, empty disables persistence).

- **12 regression tests** covering: case-insensitive lookup,
  empty-name delete, disk persistence across instances, corrupt-file
  recovery, 64-char name limit, `/api/devices` merge, `/api/aliases`
  GET/POST/DELETE, 503 when store unconfigured, 403 when write-auth
  denies, 400 on bad JSON, read-endpoint bypasses auth.

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md`'s `argusweb` block extends the Stable wire surface
  with the alias field on `/api/devices`, the `/api/aliases` endpoint
  set, and the two new options.

### Caveats

- iOS/Android "private WiFi address" rotates the MAC over time. Aliases
  are keyed by the MAC observed at the time of naming; when the OS
  rotates, the new MAC has no alias until renamed again. This is
  inherent to the privacy feature. Users who want stable names on
  iOS can disable per-network MAC randomization under
  Settings → WiFi → (network name) → Private WiFi Address.
- The JSON store is best-effort: a crash between `rename` and
  `fsync` (on power loss, not normal process exit) can revert the
  last write. Fine for a dashboard affordance; don't treat it as a
  system of record.

---

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-10

User request: dashboard device list should show an explicit
online/offline status column AND keep offline devices visible
instead of dropping them on disconnect.

### Added · 新增

- **Offline retention in `argusweb`** (opt-in, defaults on):
  `argusweb.Server` now maintains an in-process offline cache fed
  by SSE `EventOffline`/`EventOnline`/`EventChange` events. `/api/devices`
  merges the Watcher's `Known()` (online) with the offline cache
  (recently departed) into one list. Two new `Option`s:
  - `argusweb.WithOfflineRetention(d time.Duration)` — TTL for
    offline entries (default 7 days, zero disables retention)
  - `argusweb.WithOfflineMax(n int)` — soft cap; oldest entry is
    evicted when exceeded (default 512, zero disables the cap)

  Library surface is untouched — this is a dashboard-layer
  concern. `argus.Watcher.Known()` still means "currently online"
  and is unchanged.

- **`/api/devices` wire shape extension**:
  - Top-level body gains `online: N` and `offline: N` counts
  - Each row gains `status: "online" | "offline"` (mandatory) and
    `offline_at_ms` (unix-ms, set when status is "offline")
  - Rows are sorted online-first then alphabetically by MAC so the
    active fleet is always on top
  - Backward-compatible: existing fields are unchanged; the new
    fields are additive

- **Dashboard · Status column** (`argusweb/assets/dashboard.html`):
  - New leftmost column shows a green "在线" pill for online
    devices, a red "离线 N分钟前" pill for offline devices with a
    compact relative-time suffix
  - Offline rows are desaturated (55% opacity) so the eye is
    drawn to the online set first
  - Header count pill split into two: "在线 N" + "离线 N"
  - Mobile cards reshuffle: MAC + status pill on row 1, host/IP
    on row 2, link/radio + RSSI on row 3

- **7 new regression tests** in `argusweb/server_test.go`:
  - `TestDevicesOfflineEventRetainsDevice`
  - `TestDevicesOnlineEventEvictsFromOffline`
  - `TestDevicesOfflineRetentionTTL` — 20 ms TTL
  - `TestDevicesOfflineCapEvictsOldest` — max=2 eviction
  - `TestDevicesChangeEventUpdatesOfflineCacheEntry`
  - `TestDevicesStatusFieldAlwaysPresent`

---

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-10

Patch release. Fixes the "device keeps flashing online/offline on the
web UI" user report. Two root causes in one cycle:

### Fixed · 修复

- **Library — WiFi reconnects no longer mislabel as wired** — when a
  phone disconnected and reassociated to the same SSID, the
  post-reconnect `Online` event was built from syslog+DHCP only (no
  `ubus` call during the handshake), leaving `Radio` and `SSID` empty.
  `Device.Wired()` returns `true` when `Radio == ""`, so the dashboard
  rendered a transient "有线 wired" badge for a WiFi device, followed
  ~1 s later by an `EventChange` filling in `Radio: "" → "5G"`. The
  net UX was a three-event burst — `OFFLINE → ONLINE (as wired) →
  CHANGE (to WiFi)` — for every single phone reconnect.

  Fix: `Watcher` now retains a `lastShape` map (MAC → last-observed
  `Radio` / `SSID` / `Vendor` / `Type` / `Channel`) that survives
  removal from `known`. `handleConnectHint` seeds the emitted
  `Device` from this cache when available, so the initial `Online`
  already carries the correct wireless fields. The diff poll loop
  refreshes the cache each tick. `WithBaseline` entries are also
  seeded on Run start. No API surface change.

  Added regression test `TestHandleConnectHintPreservesWirelessShape`.
  (`watcher.go`, `watcher_test.go`)

- **Dashboard — reconnect bursts coalesce into one row** — the
  events list now detects same-MAC events within a 10 s window and
  upgrades the existing row in place instead of inserting three
  separate entries:

  | Prev pill | Incoming | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | OFFLINE | ONLINE | **RECONNECT** · "重连 RECONNECTED" |
  | ONLINE | OFFLINE | **FLAP** · "抖动 FLAP" |
  | any | CHANGE | keep previous pill, refresh detail |

  A WiFi reassociation now produces a single row that says
  "RECONNECT" with current device info, instead of three rows that
  look like real flapping. Devices outside the 10 s window still get
  a fresh row, so genuine disconnects + late reconnects are visible.
  (`argusweb/assets/dashboard.html`)

Desktop layout and library API are unchanged.

---

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-10

Patch release. Responsive rework of the embedded dashboard so the
HTTP UI reads well on phones. No library / API changes; single-file
change to `argusweb/assets/dashboard.html`.

### Fixed · 修复

- **Mobile UX** for the built-in Web UI (`argusweb`):
  - 5-column device table collapses into stacked **cards** below the
    640 px breakpoint. Each card shows MAC + RSSI on the top row,
    hostname + IP on the second, radio / SSID / wired badge on the
    third, with proper wrapping for long hostnames (previously the
    desktop table forced horizontal scroll on narrow viewports).
  - Header: status pills stack below the title on narrow screens
    (previously they pushed off the right edge).
  - Events list: grid-template-areas layout so timestamp + pill
    stay on line 1, MAC + detail on line 2, instead of a single
    overflowing line. Page-level scrolling on mobile (removed the
    inner `max-height: 70vh` overflow container on narrow
    viewports — mobile users expect to swipe the page, not a
    nested region).
  - `viewport-fit=cover` + `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding so the
    layout respects iPhone notches / home-bar. `theme-color`
    matches the dark background so the iOS status bar blends.
  - Long hostnames / MACs now `word-break: break-all` instead of
    forcing horizontal scroll.

Desktop layout is unchanged above 640 px — same 2-column grid,
same table, same SSE event list.

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **built-in dashboard**: a zero-dependency, single-file HTTP +
Server-Sent Events UI embedded in the binary. Opt-in via a new
`-listen` flag in `argusd`; the core library is unchanged (the
dashboard ships in a separate `argusweb` subpackage so consumers who
don't want `net/http` in their binary can skip it).

No breaking change.

### Added · 新增

- **`argusweb` subpackage** — HTTP + SSE dashboard:
  - `argusweb.NewServer(*argus.Watcher) *Server` — constructs an
    `http.Handler` with three routes
  - `(*Server).OnEvent(Event)` — fan-out entry; wire it alongside
    your `EventHandler` so incoming events stream to connected
    dashboard clients
  - `(*Server).Shutdown(ctx)` — drains SSE subscribers
  - HTTP surface:
    - `GET /` — single embedded HTML page with vanilla JS +
      EventSource (no CDN, no framework, no build step)
    - `GET /api/devices` — JSON snapshot of the current `Known()`
      set, keyed by the stable JSON field names from STABILITY.md
    - `GET /api/events` — Server-Sent Events stream; event names
      match `EventKind.String()` (`ONLINE` / `OFFLINE` / `CHANGE`);
      `data:` payload is the same JSON shape as
      `json.Marshal(argus.Event{})`
  - **Slow-subscriber safety**: each SSE connection has an 8-slot
    buffered channel; `OnEvent` drops events for subscribers whose
    buffers are full, so a stuck client never pins memory or blocks
    other subscribers
  - **Dashboard UX**: dark theme, bilingual labels (EN/中文), live
    RSSI-tiered color coding, 30 s periodic re-sync in case an
    event was dropped, auto-reconnect on transient disconnects
  - Zero third-party dependencies (`net/http` + `embed` from stdlib)
  - 6 unit tests: index HTML, 404, devices JSON, SSE hello frame,
    SSE event delivery, slow-subscriber drop, Shutdown cleanup

- **`argusd -listen=<addr>` flag** — opt-in Web UI:
  ```bash
  /tmp/argusd -listen=127.0.0.1:9099
  # then: curl -N http://127.0.0.1:9099/api/events
  # or open http://127.0.0.1:9099/ in a browser
  ```
  Unset (default) = no HTTP server, zero overhead. Bind to
  `127.0.0.1` for local-only access; put a reverse proxy in front
  for auth + TLS if you want remote access. Graceful shutdown
  wired into both SIGINT/SIGTERM and the Run-exit path. HTTP write
  timeout is disabled (SSE streams are long-lived) but read
  timeout stays at 10 s for request headers.

### Fixed · 修复

- **`argusd` SIGUSR1 control-flow bug** (discovered during the
  v0.12.0 soak): the SIGUSR1 handler lived in the main `for-select`
  next to the Run lifecycle branches. After printing the metrics
  snapshot, the outer loop iterated and started a second `Run()`,
  which immediately returned `ErrAlreadyRunning` and killed the
  daemon via `log.Fatalf`. Moved the handler to a dedicated
  goroutine bound to `exitCtx`. SIGHUP (which genuinely intends
  to restart Run) stays in the main loop. (`cmd/argusd/main.go`)

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` Stable surface extended with `argusweb.Server` +
  its method set.
- `SOAK_v0.12.0.md` — 5-minute router soak report covering the
  SIGUSR1 bug, the fix, and the clean re-run.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **tracing + fuzz hardening**: opt-in distributed-tracing hook
(adapter for OpenTelemetry / OpenTracing / Datadog in ~15 lines) plus
fuzz targets for the two untrusted-text parsing surfaces.
Non-breaking — zero observable cost when the span hook is unregistered.

### Added · 新增

- **Distributed tracing hook** (`span.go`):
  - `SpanRecorder` interface — `Start(ctx, name) (ctx, finish func(error))`
  - `SpanRecorderFunc` adapter (mirror of `http.HandlerFunc`)
  - `WithSpanRecorder(r SpanRecorder) Option`
  - Currently wired at two lifecycle points: `argus.Run` (top-level
    span covering the baseline fetch + poll loop) and
    `argus.handleDisconnectHint` (the multi-stage 500 ms wait +
    ping + emit path — the only non-trivial logical trace in the
    library)
  - Panic isolation: recorder panics in both `Start` and `finish`
    are recovered; tracing failures never kill the caller
  - When unregistered (the default), every `startSpan` call site
    returns a shared `noopFinish` — single nil check, zero
    closure allocation
  - OTel adapter is ~15 lines (see godoc on `SpanRecorder`)

- **Fuzz targets** (`fuzz_test.go`):
  - `FuzzParseSyslogLine` — the syslog line parser is an
    untrusted-text surface (anything running on the router can emit
    lines via `logger(1)`). 10 seeds drawn from real MT7981
    samples. Ran 3 s locally at 18 K exec/s with no panics.
  - `FuzzLoadDHCPLeases` — `/tmp/dhcp.leases` parser. 8 seeds
    covering malformed whitespace, short rows, non-UTF-8. 3 s run
    at 1.5 K exec/s with no panics.
  - CI runs both for 5 s each on Go 1.25 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
    so regressions show up on PR before release.

### Changed · 变更

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — added `Fuzz smoke` step gated on
  `matrix.go == '1.25'` (fuzz engine is more stable on the newest
  toolchain).

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` Stable surface extended with `SpanRecorder` /
  `SpanRecorderFunc` / `WithSpanRecorder`.

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **discoverability polish**: package-level godoc overview,
English error chain for observability pipelines, and main-package
test coverage raised from 66.8% to 75.1%. Non-breaking —
`Error()` strings change wording but the error surface (sentinels,
`errors.Is` / `errors.As` matching) is unchanged.

### Added · 新增

- **Package-level `doc.go`** — architecture diagram, quick-start,
  extension points, lifecycle, observability, error-handling, and
  supported-Go-version summary. pkg.go.dev now renders a proper
  overview at the top of the package page instead of the terse
  one-paragraph summary. (`doc.go`)

- **New tests** (12 total) raising main-package coverage to 75.1%:
  - `coverage_fills_test.go` — table-driven coverage for
    `DecisionKind.String` / `.Label` / `.MarshalJSON`,
    `LogLevel.String`, `ConfigError.Error`, `Decision.String`,
    `contains` helper, `isIn172` boundary, `WithDecisionHandler`
    registration, `DefaultHintSource.invalidateCache`,
    `invalidateHintsCache`, `EnsureFetcher` pre-set short-circuit
  - `enrich_parsers_test.go` — `loadARPCommand` with empty argv,
    bad executable, and synthetic `echo`-backed payload parsing
    (covers the IPv4 / IPv6 / FAILED / INCOMPLETE filter paths)
  - Added 2 cases to `timezone_test.go`: `TZ=CST-8` POSIX parsing
    and `TZ=UTC` IANA fallback

### Changed · 变更

- **Error messages translated to English** (13 call sites in
  `detect.go` / `fetcher.go` / `hostapd.go` / `logwatch.go` /
  `watcher.go`). Rationale: error chains flow through structured
  log pipelines and APMs; mixed-language error strings made
  grouping / dashboards harder for non-Chinese-speaking operators.
  User-facing Chinese content (decision `Label()` text, CLI table
  banner, `Config.String()` summary) is **unchanged** — product
  UX stays bilingual where appropriate.
  - `"无法读取 ubus 服务列表"` → `"list ubus services"`
  - `"未在 ubus 上找到 ahsapd.sta 或 hostapd.* 服务"` → `"no ahsapd.sta or hostapd.* service found on ubus"`
  - `"调用 ubus ahsapd.sta getStaInfo 失败"` → `"ubus call ahsapd.sta getStaInfo"`
  - `"解析 ubus 返回 JSON 失败"` → `"parse ubus ahsapd.sta JSON"`
  - `"hostapd 接口探测失败"` → `"detect hostapd interfaces"`
  - `"解析 %s get_status JSON 失败"` → `"parse %s get_status JSON"`
  - `"获取 logread stdout 失败"` → `"open logread stdout"`
  - `"启动 logread 失败"` → `"start logread"`
  - `"logread 扫描错误"` → `"logread scan error"`
  - `"logread 进程退出"` → `"logread process exited"`
  - `"onEvent 不能为 nil"` → `"onEvent must not be nil"`
  - `"初始基线拉取失败"` → `"baseline fetch"`
  - `"系统日志监听异常退出"` → `"syslog watcher exited"`
  - syslog drop counter message translated to English

### Documentation

- `doc.go` rewritten from 22 lines to a full package overview
  (architecture map, quick-start, extension points, lifecycle,
  observability, stability, supported Go versions).

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **label-bucketed metrics**: the unlabeled `argusmetrics.Counters`
answers "how many OFFLINE events total?", but production observability
pipelines usually need "how many OFFLINE events *per SSID*, *per band*,
*per MAC*?" Previously consumers wrote a custom `DecisionHandler` with
their own sharded map; v0.10.0 ships a standard implementation.

No breaking change.

### Added · 新增

- **`argusmetrics.LabeledCounters`** — Prometheus-style `CounterVec`
  equivalent, without the Prometheus dependency:
  ```go
  m := argusmetrics.NewLabeled([]string{"ssid", "band"}, extractor)
  w := argus.New(argus.WithDecisionHandler(m.OnDecision))
  // Snapshot keys: "CONNECT_EMIT|home|5G", "OFFLINE_EMIT|guest|2.4G", …
  ```
  - `NewLabeled(labels []string, extract LabelExtractor) *LabeledCounters`
  - `OnDecision(Decision)` — **40 ns/op, 2 allocs** (mutex +
    joined key); ~25× slower than the unlabeled 1.7 ns/op path,
    still negligible for Argus's decision rate
  - `Snapshot() map[string]uint64` — keys `"<kind>|<v1>|<v2>..."`,
    consumers split on "|" when bridging to a backend with
    structured labels
  - `LabelNames() []string` — defensive copy for Prometheus
    `CounterVec` declaration
  - `Reset()` — for tests
  - Arity mismatches from a broken `LabelExtractor` are silently
    dropped (prevents cardinality leaks from buggy extractors)
  (`argusmetrics/labeled.go`)

- **`LabelExtractor`** type — `func(argus.Decision) []string`. Must
  be cheap; called once per Decision.

- **`ExampleLabeledCounters`** — godoc example with `// Output:`
  directive demonstrating per-MAC bucketing. (`argusmetrics/example_test.go`)

- **Tests** (`argusmetrics/labeled_test.go`, 7 tests):
  - `TestLabeledCountersBasicKeying` — single label path
  - `TestLabeledCountersMultiLabel` — multi-label keying
  - `TestLabeledCountersArityMismatchDropped` — cardinality-leak guard
  - `TestLabeledCountersNilExtractor` — equivalent to unlabeled
  - `TestLabeledCountersConcurrentSafe` — 10 000 atomic adds / 50 goroutines
  - `TestLabeledCountersReset`
  - `TestLabeledCountersLabelNamesIsCopy` — defensive copy of label names
  - `BenchmarkLabeledOnDecision` — 40 ns/op, 2 allocs on M4

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` Stable surface extended with `LabeledCounters` /
  `NewLabeled` / `LabelExtractor` / `(*LabeledCounters).OnDecision` /
  `Snapshot` / `LabelNames` / `Reset`.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **observability polish**: structured logging hook and
field-level config validation errors. Both are purely additive —
existing consumers see no behavior change.

### Added · 新增

- **Structured logging hook** — `LoggerHandler` / `LogLevel` /
  `LogAttr` types and `WithLogger(LoggerHandler) Option`:
  ```go
  argus.WithLogger(func(ctx context.Context, level argus.LogLevel, msg string, attrs ...argus.LogAttr) {
      slog.LogAttrs(ctx, slog.Level(level), msg, toSlog(attrs)...)
  })
  ```
  The library emits at Info (watcher starting, fetcher detected,
  watcher stopped), Warn (syslog buffer overflow, fetch tick failed,
  stop timeout), and Error (detect failure). The **hot decision
  path does NOT log** — every emission is a lifecycle or
  recoverable-anomaly event. When `WithLogger` is unregistered
  (default), log call sites bail on a single nil check. Logger
  panics are recovered; they never kill the caller. Adapters for
  `log/slog`, `zap`, and `zerolog` are all ~5 lines. (`logger.go`)

- **`ConfigError` struct** — `{Field, Value, Reason}` with
  `errors.As` support. `Config.Validate` now returns a
  `*ConfigError` (still unwraps to `ErrInvalidConfig` for existing
  `errors.Is` callers):
  ```go
  var ce *argus.ConfigError
  if errors.As(err, &ce) {
      formErrors[ce.Field] = ce.Reason  // "must be > 0"
  }
  ```
  Intended for web config UIs and form-level validation feedback;
  previously consumers had to regex-match `error.Error()` to
  identify the offending field. (`errors.go`, `watcher.go:Validate`)

- **`ExampleWithLogger`** and **`ExampleConfigError`** — godoc
  examples demonstrating both new facilities. The ConfigError
  example has an `// Output:` directive verifying the message
  format, so it's regression-locked. (`example_test.go`)

- **Tests** (`logger_test.go`, 5 tests):
  - `TestLoggerReceivesLifecycleEvents` — Run emits `watcher starting` at Info
  - `TestLoggerPanicIsolated` — panicking logger doesn't kill Run
  - `TestLoggerNilIsZeroCost` — unregistered logger is a no-op
  - `TestConfigErrorExposesFieldViaAs` — errors.As extracts *ConfigError
  - `TestConfigErrorFromRunIsUnwrappable` — errors.Is still works for coarse matching

### Changed · 变更

- `Config.Validate` — error type changed from `fmt.Errorf(...)` to
  `*ConfigError`. This is **non-breaking** for existing consumers:
  the `error` interface is unchanged, `errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidConfig)`
  still works, and the `Error()` string is stable in format
  (`argus: invalid config: <reason> (field=<name> value=<v>)`).
  New field-level extraction via `errors.As` is the added value.
- `Run` — no longer double-wraps the `Validate` error with
  `fmt.Errorf("%w: %v", ErrInvalidConfig, err)`. Returns the
  `*ConfigError` directly so `errors.As(err, &ConfigError{})` works
  at the Run call site. `errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidConfig)` behavior
  is preserved via `(*ConfigError).Unwrap`.

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` Stable surface extended with `LoggerHandler` /
  `LogLevel` / `LogAttr` / `ConfigError` / `WithLogger`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **adoption readiness**: explicit Go version support policy,
formalized context cancellation contract, and the maintenance signals
(security policy, code of conduct, issue/PR templates) that enterprise
consumers check before taking a dependency. No code-level breaking
changes; the library public surface is unchanged.

### Added · 新增

- **Go version support policy** — `go.mod` declares `go 1.21` (was
  `go 1.25`). Argus supports the **current Go release and the two
  preceding minor versions** (N-2). CI matrix now tests on Go 1.21,
  1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25. Consumers on older toolchains
  (OpenWrt SDKs, embedded builds) can now pin Argus without waiting
  for their Go upgrade path. (`go.mod`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- **Context cancellation contract** — `STABILITY.md` now contains a
  formal table documenting exactly what `Run` / `Stop` / `List` /
  `EnsureFetcher` / `HintSource.Hints` / `Fetcher.Fetch` do when
  `ctx.Done()` fires mid-call or when ctx is pre-cancelled. Key
  invariants:
  - `Run` returns `nil` (not `ctx.Err()`) on graceful cancellation —
    matches `http.Server.Shutdown` convention
  - `Stop` always waits for in-flight decisions to flush; if
    `stopCtx` expires, workers still exit in the background (never
    leak)
  - `Run` + `Stop` concurrency is safe; nil ctx is a programming
    error, not silently masked
  (`STABILITY.md`)

- **`context_contract_test.go`** — 6 regression tests enforcing the
  contract: `TestContractRunReturnsNilOnCtxCancel`,
  `TestContractStopIdempotent`,
  `TestContractStopReturnsDeadlineExceeded`,
  `TestContractRunAlreadyRunning`,
  `TestContractRunStopConcurrencySafe`,
  `TestContractListReturnsFetcherError`.

- **Security policy** — [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) documents the
  private vulnerability reporting channel (email /
  GitHub security advisory), SLA (72 h ack, 7 d triage, 30 d fix
  for high/critical), supported-version table, and threat model.
  Argus is a local-network read-only observer, makes no outbound
  requests, and ships zero third-party dependencies.

- **Code of conduct** — [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  (Contributor Covenant v2.1).

- **Issue / PR templates** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`,
  `feature_request.yml`, and `config.yml` (blank issues disabled,
  security reports routed to private advisory). New
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` walks contributors through the
  stability-impact + test-plan checklist.

- **Release cadence & LTS policy** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` now documents:
  cadence (minor = theme-driven, not scheduled), supported Go
  versions (N-2), post-v1.0 LTS (current minor + security-only for
  previous minor for 6 months), and deprecation timeline (one full
  minor cycle minimum before removal).

### Fixed · 修复

- **Race in `TestSetupLocalTimezone`** — the test mutated global
  `time.Local` in a `defer`, racing with parallel tests that read
  `time.Now()`. Renamed to `TestDetectLocalLocationSafe` and
  rewritten to exercise only the non-mutating `DetectLocalLocation`
  path. Race exposed by the new multi-Go-version CI matrix
  (`go test -race -count=3`). (`timezone_test.go`)

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` adds the "Context cancellation contract" table to
  the Stable surface.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` adds "Release cadence & LTS policy" and
  "Security" sections.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **portability + observability**: make the enrichment pipeline
pluggable for non-OpenWrt targets and ship a zero-dependency metrics
collector that bridges cleanly to Prometheus / OpenTelemetry / StatsD.
No breaking change.

### Added · 新增

- **`Hint` exported type** — was previously an unexported `hint` struct.
  Now part of the Stable public surface so custom `HintSource`
  implementations can return it directly. (`enrich.go`)

- **`HintSource` interface** — single-method abstraction:
  ```go
  type HintSource interface {
      Hints(ctx context.Context) map[string]Hint
  }
  ```
  Consumers on non-OpenWrt systems (standard Linux, macOS dev loops,
  embedded devices with custom lease databases) can now inject their
  own hint source without forking internal enrichment logic.
  (`enrich.go`)

- **`DefaultHintSource` struct** — the existing `/tmp/dhcp.leases` +
  `ip neigh show` reader exposed as a configurable struct:
  - `LeasesPath string` — override default `/tmp/dhcp.leases`
  - `ARPCommand []string` — override default `["ip", "neigh", "show"]`
  - `CacheTTL time.Duration` — override default 5s cache window
  Useful for custom firmwares that store leases elsewhere (e.g.
  `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases` on stock OpenWrt 22+, or a shim
  path in tests). (`enrich.go`)

- **`WithHintSource(h HintSource) Option`** — functional option on
  `argus.New` to inject a custom source. When set, Argus bypasses
  `DefaultHintSource` entirely on every poll tick. (`watcher.go`)

- **`argusmetrics` subpackage** — zero-dependency in-process counter
  aggregator for `Decision` and `Event` streams:
  - `argusmetrics.New() *Counters` — construct
  - `Counters.OnDecision` satisfies `argus.DecisionHandler`; can be
    passed directly to `argus.WithDecisionHandler`
  - `Counters.OnEvent(Event)` — for business-level online/offline
    counts
  - `Counters.Snapshot() map[string]uint64` — stable string keys
    (`CONNECT_EMIT`, `OFFLINE_EMIT`, `EVENT_ONLINE`, …) ready to
    bridge to any metrics backend in ~10 lines
  - `Counters.Reset()` — for tests
  Hot path is **1.7 ns/op, 0 allocs** (atomic increment on a fixed
  [128]uint64 indexed by `DecisionKind`). No Prometheus, OTel, or
  StatsD dependency is pulled into Argus — consumers bridge in their
  own layer. (`argusmetrics/argusmetrics.go`)

- **`ExampleCounters`** — godoc example demonstrating the bridge
  pattern (Watcher → Counters → Snapshot → external backend).
  (`argusmetrics/example_test.go`)

- **Tests**:
  - `hintsource_test.go` — `TestWithHintSourceInjection`,
    `TestDefaultHintSourceCustomPaths`, `TestDefaultHintSourceCache`
  - `argusmetrics/argusmetrics_test.go` — concurrent-safety stress
    (10000 atomic adds across 100 goroutines), Reset, benchmark

### Changed · 变更

- Internal `hint` → `Hint` rename; all call sites updated. No
  behavior change; existing consumers that didn't depend on the
  unexported name are unaffected.
- `loadHints(ctx)` now delegates to a package-level
  `*DefaultHintSource` so the legacy call path and the new
  `HintSource` path share the same cache TTL semantics.

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` Stable surface extended with `Hint`, `HintSource`,
  `DefaultHintSource`, `WithHintSource`, and the `argusmetrics`
  subpackage (`Counters` + `OnDecision` + `OnEvent` + `Snapshot` +
  `Reset`).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-10

Focus on **config ergonomics**: make the library trivial to drop into a
daemon that reads config from a file and publishes events to Kafka /
HTTP webhooks. No breaking change.

### Added · 新增

- **`argustest` subpackage** — public test helpers for downstream:
  - `FixedFetcher{Devices, Err}` — deterministic `Fetcher` with injectable error
    and call counter
  - `FakeProber{Reach, AllReachable}` — IP-to-reachability map with concurrent
    `Set` method
  Consumers writing unit tests for business logic on top of Argus can
  `import "github.com/xxl6097/argus/argustest"` instead of forking internal
  fixtures. (`argustest/argustest.go`)

- **JSON serialization is now part of the Stable public surface** (see
  [`STABILITY.md`](./STABILITY.md)):
  - `Event` fields: `time` / `kind` / `device` / `changes`
  - `Device` fields: `mac` / `ip` / `hostname` / `vendor` / `type` / `radio` /
    `ssid` / `channel` / `rssi` / `uptime_ns` / `access_time` / `last_seen`
  - `Change` fields: `field` / `old` / `new`
  - `Decision` fields: `time` / `kind` / `mac` / `detail`
  - `Config` fields: snake_case mirrors of the Go field names
  - `EventKind` / `DecisionKind` marshal to English `String()`
    (`"ONLINE"` / `"CONNECT_EMIT"` / …), not the underlying integer. The
    integer values remain `Evolving` per STABILITY.md so renumbering stays
    safe in future versions.
  - `EventKind.UnmarshalJSON` accepts both the string form and the legacy
    integer form for backward compatibility with data serialized by older
    versions.
  All fields use `omitempty` so sparse config files / compact events stay
  small on the wire.

- **`ExampleConfig_jsonReload`** — godoc example showing `/etc/argusd.json`
  style load via `json.Unmarshal(..., &cfg)` + `argus.WithConfig(cfg)`.
  (`example_test.go`)

- **`ExampleFixedFetcher`** — godoc example in the `argustest` subpackage.
  (`argustest/example_test.go`)

- **JSON round-trip tests** — `TestEventJSONRoundTrip`,
  `TestEventKindUnmarshalFromInt`, `TestChangeJSONFields`,
  `TestConfigJSONRoundTrip`, `TestDecisionJSONFields`.
  (`json_test.go`)

### Changed · 变更

- Struct tags added to `Device` / `Event` / `Change` / `Decision` / `Config`.
  No Go-level breaking change (existing consumers unaffected); new JSON
  field names are the public contract going forward.

### Documentation

- `STABILITY.md` expanded with an explicit "JSON serialization" section
  documenting every stable field name and adds `argustest` subpackage to
  the Stable surface.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-09

Lifecycle: add graceful stop and restart on the same `*Watcher`. Closes the
last Level-5 API gap — long-running services can now hot-reload config on
SIGHUP without re-emitting Online for every known device.

### Added · 新增

- **`(*Watcher).Stop(ctx) error`** — graceful shutdown that cancels the
  internal Run ctx and waits for all spawned goroutines (syslog listener,
  hint consumer, hint workers) to exit via an internal `sync.WaitGroup`.
  - Idempotent: no-op when no Run is active.
  - Returns `context.DeadlineExceeded` on stop-ctx timeout; workers continue
    to exit in the background.
  - After Stop returns `nil`, `Run` can be called again on the same Watcher.
  (`watcher.go`)

- **`ErrAlreadyRunning` sentinel** — concurrent `Run` calls on the same
  Watcher fail-fast with this error (matchable via `errors.Is`), instead
  of silently corrupting shared state.
  (`errors.go`)

- **Restart semantics** — on second `Run`:
  - **Preserved**: `known`, `offlineCooldown`, `lastEventAt`, detected
    `Fetcher` / `detectKind` (`sync.Once` caches)
  - **Reset**: `misses`, `disconnectInFlight`, `syslogHints` channel
    (recreated), `droppedHints` counter
  Rationale: timeless state should survive config reload; transient state
  from the previous run would poison new decisions.
  (`watcher.go:Run`)

- **`ExampleWatcher_Stop`** — SIGHUP hot-reload pattern runnable on
  pkg.go.dev. (`example_test.go`)

- **9 regression tests** in `lifecycle_test.go`:
  - `TestRunConcurrentReturnsAlreadyRunning`
  - `TestStopIdempotent` / `TestStopBeforeRun`
  - `TestRunAfterStopSucceeds`
  - `TestRestartPreservesKnownAndCooldown`
  - `TestRestartResetsTransients`
  - `TestStopWaitsForDisconnectWorker` — uses a slow prober to force a
    real worker wait, verifies Stop blocks ≥ 300ms
  - `TestStopWithTimeout` — verifies `context.DeadlineExceeded` surface
  - `TestGoroutineLeakOnRestart` — 30-cycle Run/Stop loop, asserts
    goroutine count stable within ±5

### Changed · 变更

- `Run` docstring no longer claims "不支持多次 Run"; now documents the
  CAS guard, restart semantics, and state-preservation contract.
- New `Watcher` fields (unexported): `running atomic.Bool`, `runWG sync.WaitGroup`,
  `runCancel context.CancelFunc`.
- Hint worker goroutines in `runSyslogConsumer` now register with `runWG`
  so `Stop` waits for them to complete.
- `runSyslog` and `runSyslogConsumer` now capture the current Run's
  `syslogHints` channel by value at entry, ensuring no race with the
  channel's recreation on restart.

### STABILITY

`STABILITY.md` v1.0 checklist item for multi-Run support removed (now
implemented). `Stop` and `ErrAlreadyRunning` added to the Stable public
surface.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

Focus on **production-grade robustness**: user callbacks can no longer kill
Watcher goroutines, the zero-cost `DecisionHandler` claim is now CI-backed,
pkg.go.dev shows runnable examples, and the API stability contract is explicit.

### Added · 新增

- **Panic isolation for all user callbacks**
  `EventHandler` / `ErrorHandler` / `DecisionHandler` / `OnFetcherDetected`
  are now wrapped in `defer recover()`. A panic in user code:
  - `EventHandler` — caught, reported to `onError` as
    `"argus: EventHandler panicked: <value>"`, and does NOT kill the diff
    goroutine. Subsequent events continue to flow.
  - `ErrorHandler` — caught and silently swallowed (no recursion).
  - `DecisionHandler` — caught and silently swallowed (hot path).
  - `OnFetcherDetected` — caught and silently swallowed.
  (`watcher.go`)

- **`diff()` emits events after releasing `stateMu`**
  Internally refactored to collect events into a `pending []Event` slice.
  `Run` dispatches them via `safeInvokeEvent` AFTER unlocking the mutex.
  Prior to this, a slow or panicking user callback would hold `stateMu`,
  blocking `Known()`, `List()`, and the next poll tick.
  (`watcher.go`)

- **`example_test.go` — 6 runnable godoc examples**
  Covers `New`, `Watcher.List`, `WithDecisionHandler`, `WithBaseline`,
  `Config` tuning, and typed-error handling. pkg.go.dev now renders them
  as "Try it" code blocks at the top of the package page.
  (`example_test.go`)

- **Benchmarks backing the zero-cost `DecisionHandler` claim**
  - `BenchmarkEmitDecisionNil`: **1.0 ns/op, 0 allocs/op** on M4
  - `BenchmarkEmitDecisionActive`: 33 ns/op, 0 allocs/op (defer+recover overhead)
  - `BenchmarkSafeInvokeEventOK`: monitors panic-safe wrapper cost in normal path
  Makes the docstring promise a CI-enforceable guarantee.
  (`panic_test.go`)

- **`STABILITY.md` — explicit API compatibility contract**
  Lists "Stable" / "Evolving" / "Unstable" surface, documents the
  **minor-zero-stable** policy for the 0.x line, and defines the 7-point
  checklist required before tagging v1.0.
  (`STABILITY.md`)

### Changed · 变更

- `diff()` signature: dropped `onEvent EventHandler`, now returns
  `[]Event` of pending events. The `Run` caller dispatches via the new
  panic-safe path. **This is an internal function**; no public API impact.
- `handleDisconnectHint()` / `emitConnectEvent()` now take `onError` so
  their direct `onEvent` calls can report callback panics. Internal-only.
- `ScheduleOnFetcherDetected` callback invocation now also recovers from
  panics (detector runs once under `sync.Once`).

### Tests · 测试

- `TestEventHandlerPanicDoesNotKillWatcher` — verifies panic capture and
  error reporting.
- `TestErrorHandlerPanicDoesNotRecurse` — verifies 1-second max duration
  when `ErrorHandler` itself panics (no recursion).
- `TestDecisionHandlerPanicSwallowed`
- `TestDiffEventPanicContained` — verifies event-N panic does not block
  event-N+1 delivery.

All pass under `go test -race`.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-09

Focus on **API ergonomics & robustness** — no behavior change for existing users
on default config, new opt-in knobs for lifecycle handoff and feature toggling,
and typed errors for programmatic error handling.

### Added · 新增

- **`Config.DisableCooldown` / `Config.DisableFlapSuppression`**
  Explicit boolean switches to turn off cooldown / flap-suppression. Previously
  required the magic value `time.Nanosecond` or `FlapSuppressionWindow=0`
  (which the `WithConfig` zero-value convention treated as "preserve default").
  Default `false` preserves existing behavior. (`watcher.go`)

- **`Watcher.Known() map[string]Device`**
  Thread-safe deep-copy snapshot of the currently-known device set, for use
  with the new `WithBaseline` option. (`watcher.go`)

- **`WithBaseline(map[string]Device) Option`**
  Seeds a new `Watcher`'s `known` set at construction time. Intended for hot
  reload / process restart: take `old.Known()`, pass to `New(WithBaseline(snap))`
  to avoid the entire device table re-emitting as "new online" events on boot.
  (`watcher.go`)

- **Sentinel errors** (`errors.go`)
  - `ErrHandlerRequired` — `Run` called with `nil` `onEvent`
  - `ErrInvalidConfig` — `Config.Validate()` rejected the config
  - `ErrNoFetcher` — ubus auto-detect found no `ahsapd` / `hostapd`
  - `ErrFetchFailed` — initial baseline fetch failed

  All reachable via `errors.Is`. Existing `fmt.Errorf` wrappers are preserved
  for their human-readable context.

### Changed · 变更

- **`Run` now calls `Config.Validate()` at entry.** Previously `Config` validation
  was exported but only invoked by user code. Invalid configs now fail fast before
  any goroutine starts, returning `ErrInvalidConfig`. No behavior change for
  users on `DefaultConfig()` / sane configs. (`watcher.go`)

### Deprecated · 废弃

- **`SetupLocalTimezone()`** is marked `Deprecated` in its docstring. It mutates
  global `time.Local`, which is a library anti-pattern. Consumers should use
  `DetectLocalLocation()` to get a `*time.Location` and format with
  `t.In(loc)` (or set `time.Local` in their own `main`). The function itself
  is retained for backward compatibility and will not be removed.
  (`timezone.go`)

### Tests · 测试

- `TestRunReturnsSentinelErrHandlerRequired` / `TestRunReturnsSentinelErrInvalidConfig`
- `TestConfigDisableCooldownStopsSuppression`
- `TestConfigDisableFlapSuppression`
- `TestWithBaselineSeedsKnown`
- `TestKnownReturnsIndependentCopy`

All pass under `go test -race`.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed · 变更

- **Disconnect hint dedup** · 断开提示去重
  `handleDisconnectHint` now tracks an in-flight MAC set and short-circuits
  duplicate hints. A typical disconnect emits 3 syslog lines (disconnect /
  deauth / Del Sta) within milliseconds, spawning 3 workers. Previously all
  three entered the 500 ms wait + ping path; the second/third only no-op'd
  after the first deleted the MAC from `known`. Now only the first worker
  runs the full path; the rest emit `DISCONNECT_SKIP_INFLIGHT` and return
  immediately. Saves ≈ 2 × (500 ms sleep + ping cost) and avoids redundant
  ping of an already-known-offline IP under burst.
  No behavior change to event emissions — still exactly one `EventOffline`
  per logical disconnect.
  Observed on a real MT7981 router: 3 `DISCONNECT_HINT` traces previously
  all entered the slow path; now 1 runs and 2 are skipped. (`watcher.go`,
  `decision.go`)

### Added · 新增

- New `DecisionKind`: `DecisionDisconnectSkippedInflight` (string
  `DISCONNECT_SKIP_INFLIGHT`, label "跳过(已在处理)"). Surfaces the
  dedup decision in `DecisionHandler` traces. (`decision.go`)
- Test `TestHandleDisconnectHintDedupesInFlight` covers the dedup path
  under `-race`. (`watcher_test.go`)

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

Initial public release · 首次公开发布。

### Added · 新增

- **Multi-source fusion engine** · 多源融合引擎
  Fuse six data sources into one event stream: `ahsapd` / `hostapd.*` (via `ubus`),
  `logread -f` syslog stream, `/tmp/dhcp.leases`, `ip neigh` ARP states, ICMP
  liveness probe. Emits `EventOnline` / `EventOffline` / `EventChange`.
  (`watcher.go`, `fetcher.go`, `hostapd.go`, `logwatch.go`, `enrich.go`, `prober.go`)

- **Zero-config vendor detection** · 零配置多厂商兼容
  `DetectFetcher` auto-selects `AhsapdFetcher` when `ahsapd.sta` is on `ubus`,
  falls back to `HostapdFetcher` scanning all `hostapd.*` interfaces.
  (`detect.go`)

- **Sub-second event pipeline** · 毫秒级事件管线
  Channel A (`runSyslog` → `runSyslogConsumer`, 16 concurrent workers) produces
  online/offline hints in ~0–1.5 s via kernel logs (`New Sta`, `AP SETKEYS DONE`,
  `DHCPACK`, `Del Sta`, `DE-AUTH`, `wifi_sys_disconn_act`).
  Channel B polls every `PollInterval` (default 1 s) as fallback.
  (`watcher.go:runSyslog`, `runSyslogConsumer`, `handleConnectHint`,
  `handleDisconnectHint`)

- **Three-layer offline filter** · 三层离线筛选
  (1) `ICMPProber` ping filter; (2) AP association table + RSSI tiers
  (`WeakRSSI` / `ExtremelyWeakRSSI`); (3) ARP `FAILED`/`INCOMPLETE` state.
  (`prober.go:filterAlive`, `watcher.go:diff`)

- **Flap suppression: cooldown + window** · 抗抖动: 冷却期 + 抖动窗口
  `OfflineCooldown` (default 90 s) with `CooldownReleaseRSSI` (default -65 dBm)
  covers long-duration weak-signal thrashing; `FlapSuppressionWindow` (default
  30 s) covers short-time same-kind flapping. Cooldown is refreshed on every
  suppress so devices stay hidden until signal recovers.
  (`watcher.go:emitConnectEvent`, `shouldSuppressFlap`, `diff`)

- **`DecisionHandler` observability** · 决策回调可观测性
  16 `DecisionKind` branches expose the full internal decision chain
  (`CONNECT_HINT`, `CONNECT_EMIT`, `COOLDOWN_SUPPRESS_*`, `FLAP_SUPPRESS_*`,
  `POLL_SLEEP_PROTECT`, `POLL_WEAK_MISS`, `POLL_ARP_FAILED`, `POLL_MISSES_EXHAUSTED`,
  `DISCONNECT_PING_OK`, `OFFLINE_EMIT`, …). Zero-cost when no handler registered
  (no allocations, no `time.Now()` call).
  (`decision.go`)

- **Syslog consumer concurrency cap** · 系统日志消费者并发上限
  Semaphore of 16 bounds goroutines spawned from `syslogHints`; 256-element
  buffered channel with atomic `droppedHints` counter and 30 s aggregated
  `onError` reporting under burst.
  (`watcher.go:runSyslogConsumer`, `runSyslog`)

- **Hint cache with 5 s TTL** · 5 秒 TTL 的 hints 缓存
  `loadHints` memoizes `/tmp/dhcp.leases` + `ip neigh show` output to avoid
  per-hint forks during WiFi handshake bursts.
  (`enrich.go`)

- **`RenderTable` formatter** · 表格输出
  Human-readable CLI table for `[]Device` with Chinese labels.
  (`format.go`)

- **`SetupLocalTimezone`** · 路由器本机时区解析
  Parses `/etc/TZ` (e.g. `CST-8`) into `time.Local` so syslog timestamps match
  the router's wall clock.
  (`timezone.go`)

- **Reference CLI `argusd`** · 参考命令行 `argusd`
  Prints device table on start, then streams live events + decisions.
  (`cmd/argusd/main.go`)

- **GitHub Actions CI/release pipeline** · GitHub Actions CI/发布流程
  `ci.yml` runs `go vet` + `go test -race` and cross-compiles 5 targets on
  every push/PR. `release.yml` triggers on `v*.*.*` tag push and publishes
  a GitHub Release with binaries for 10 OpenWrt-relevant targets (`amd64`,
  `386`, `arm64`, `armv5`, `armv7`, `mips/mipsle softfloat`,
  `mips64/mips64le softfloat`, `riscv64`) plus aggregated `SHA256SUMS`.
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`)

- **Bilingual documentation** · 双语文档
  `README.md` (overview + API), `ONLINE.md` (online decision deep-dive),
  `OFFLINE.md` (offline + cooldown analysis), `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Security · 安全

- **IP input validated twice** · IP 双重校验
  `ICMPProber.Reachable` validates IPs with regex `^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$`
  AND `net.ParseIP`, blocking command injection into `ping`.
  (`prober.go`)
- **Hostapd interface whitelist** · hostapd 接口白名单
  `HostapdFetcher` only accepts interfaces discovered through `ubus list`
  (prefix `hostapd.`), preventing arbitrary service names in shell args.
  (`detect.go`, `hostapd.go`)

### Known limitations · 已知限制

- Stock OpenWrt 23.05+ `hostapd.*` path is implemented but not yet tested on
  real hardware; MediaTek MT7981 vendor firmware (`ahsapd`) is the reference
  target.
- IPv6-only devices are not yet tracked (ARP/DHCP-v4 sources only).
- `argusd --version` flag not yet wired (planned for a later release; the
  linker does set `main.version` via `-ldflags=-X`).
